# Random Cipher Generator

Encrypt and decrypt messages with a simple random cipher generator! This Python script uses a randomly shuffled key to transform your input into a secure, encoded message. It's a fun and educational way to explore basic encryption concepts.

## Usage

1. Run the script and input a message to encrypt.
2. The program will generate a unique ciphered message based on a shuffled key.
3. To decrypt, enter the ciphered message, and the original text will be revealed.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different messages. Enhance your understanding of encryption techniques while having some coding fun!
